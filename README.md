# My Advent Of Code

This repository is meant to hold my solutions to the Advent of Code challenge.

# Structure

There is one directory per year. 

In each year directory, there's a "summary.txt" files that keeps track of the puzzles I solved and of the time I took to solve them. Then, there is a sub-directory for each day. In each day directory, there are 2 input files (the "example" and the "input", properly said) and sub-directories holding my solutions for each language I used
