# My Advent Of Code

This repository is meant to hold my solutions to the Advent of Code challenge.

# Structure

* There is one directory per year. 

* In each year directory, there's a "summary.txt" files that keeps track of the puzzles I solved, the days I actually solved them and the running execution time (roughly) in a reference langage (often Python)

* There is a sub-directory for each day. 

* In each day directory, there are 2 or 3 input files : the "example" (maybe 2 "example1" and "example2" if the given examples are different between level 1 and level 2) and the "input", properly said

* In each day directory, there are sub-directorie(s) hoto solve them.lding my solutions, for each language I used
